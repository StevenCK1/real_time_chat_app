# real_time_chat_app

[Front End](https://real-time-chat-app-sc.vercel.app)
Deployed server on Render.com (could have used Harperdb's [custom functions](https://harperdb.io/docs/custom-functions/) but since server was created with socket.io, cannot use Harperdb's own API)
Database hosted on HarperDB, minimal postgreSQL code to create table.
